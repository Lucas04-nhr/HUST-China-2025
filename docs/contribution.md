#### Bronze Medal Criterion \#3

Make a useful contribution for future iGEM teams and document it on this page.

Visit the [Medals page](https://competition.igem.org/judging/medals) for more
information.

## What Should this Page Contain?

Teams must document their contribution and explain why their effort is a
contribution to fellow iGEMers. There is no single definition of what a
contribution should be. We invite teams to be creative and generous in the
knowledge, data or tools they may provide to the community.

A few examples of contributions are:

- Creating a new BioBrick part or significantly improving an existing one in the
  iGEM Registry.
- Developing software, tools, or resources that can considerably assist future
  iGEM teams.
- Sharing optimized protocols, experimental techniques, or methodologies.
- Any other contributions that provide a clear benefit to future iGEM teams.
