#### Best Sustainable Development Impact

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a call to action to integrally
address global environmental, social, and economic challenges. iGEM teams can
answer this call with this prize. Demonstrate how you have evaluated your
project ideas against one or more of the SDGs, how you’ve consulted with SDG
stakeholders, and how you’ve begun to form collaborations with other iGEM teams
around the SDGs. You’re encouraged to look back at previous iGEM projects to
evaluate them against the SDGs, and build upon them.
