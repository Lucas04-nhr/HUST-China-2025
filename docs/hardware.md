#### Best Hardware

This is a prize for the team that has developed a piece of hardware for
synthetic biology. Hardware in iGEM should make synthetic biology based on
standard parts easier, faster, better or more accessible to our community. Did
your team make a sensor to help teams characterize parts? Did you make a robot
that can help teams perform experiments or do cloning more easily? Strong
competitors for this prize will demonstrate utility, user testing, and easy
reproducibility.

## Overview

In addition to encouraging teams to work with DNA parts and build biological
devices in the lab, iGEM also encourages other types of technical solutions for
synthetic biology. This can include physical devices (hardware) related to
robotic assembly, microfluidics, low-cost measurement devices, to name a few
examples. There are many exciting opportunities for hardware innovation in
synthetic biology.
