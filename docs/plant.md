#### Best Plant Synthetic Biology

This award is designed to celebrate exemplary work done in plant synthetic
biology. Did you build a project in a plant chassis? Did you submit plant parts
to the Registry? This award could also be given to a team working with algae or
another eukaryotic photosynthetic chassis. Show us what you made and remember to
adhere to iGEM safety guidelines!

_Note: Photosynthetic bacteria cannot be considered for this prize._
