#### Silver Medal Criterion \#1

Demonstrate engineering success in a technical aspect of your project by going
through at least one iteration of the engineering design cycle.

Visit the [Medals page](https://competition.igem.org/judging/medals) for more
information.

## What Should this Page Contain?

Engineering success can be achieved by documenting your effort to follow the
engineering design cycle: Design → Build → Test → Learn

We invite you to think about ways to tackle and solve one or more of your
project's problems and use synthetic biology tools and/or experimental
techniques to generate expected results.

When you have completed the cycle once, think about and document what changes in
design you would make for the next iteration(s) of the cycle.

For example, you can design and build a new Part, measure its performance,
document whether it worked or not, and propose how the results would inform the
next design or steps (documentation must be on the Part's Pages on the
Registry).

Visit the [Engineering pages](https://technology.igem.org/engineering) for
additional guidance on engineering success.
