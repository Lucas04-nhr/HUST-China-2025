#### Best Measurement

Measurements are critical to scientific communication and advancement.
Well-reported measurements are the only way to show whether hardware is
functioning correctly, whether data are reliable and whether a result is
actually important. There is high value in identifying appropriate targets for
measurement, collecting precise measurements, and reporting results clearly and
with appropriate units. Document your careful measurement efforts and you could
win this award!
