## Essential First Steps

Familiarize yourself with the official iGEM competition rules, policies, and
judging criteria:

- Carefully review
  the [Wiki Requirements page](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki) to
  ensure your wiki meets all necessary standards for judging and awards.
- Understand the criteria and required wiki pages for Gold, Silver, and Bronze
  Medals on the [Medals page](https://competition.igem.org/judging/medals).

  on
  the [Project Prizes Page](https://competition.igem.org/judging/project-prizes).

  the [Special Prizes Page](https://competition.igem.org/judging/special-prizes).

## Building Your Wiki

- **Content First, Design Second**: Focus on clearly documenting your project,
  research, and activities. Design can be refined later.
- **Navigation is Key**: Structure your wiki with clear and intuitive
  navigation. Visitors should easily find information.
- **Accessibility Matters**: Use readable fonts, appropriate color contrast, and
  ensure your wiki is mobile-friendly.
- **Media Optimization**: Compress images and videos to reduce file sizes and
  improve loading times.
- **Document Early & Often**: Start documenting your project from day one. Don't
  wait until the Wiki Freeze.
- **Prepare for Deadlines**: Stay up-to-date with important deadlines and events
  by checking
  the [iGEM Competition Calendar](https://competition.igem.org/calendar).

## Tips for Success

- **Clearly Define Your Project**: Explain your project's goals, methodology,
  and expected outcomes in a clear and concise manner.
- **Show Your Progress**: Regularly update your wiki with your team's progress,
  experiments, and results.
- **Engage Your Audience**: Consider your global audience and use language that
  is accessible to everyone.
- **Human Practices & Safety**: Thoroughly document your team's human practices
  activities and safety considerations.
- **Collaborate & Share**: Highlight collaborations with other teams and
  institutions.
- **Have Fun and Learn!** iGEM is a unique opportunity to learn, grow, and
  contribute to synthetic biology.
