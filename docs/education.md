#### Best Education

Innovative educational tools and outreach activities have the ability to
establish a two-way dialogue with new communities by discussing public values
and the science behind synthetic biology. How have you developed new
opportunities to include more people in shaping synthetic biology? Education
activities do not have to be directly related to your project but may look at
wider issues of iGEM or synthetic biology. Education activities must promote
scientific learning and avoid simply proselytizing or marketing synthetic
biology and/or iGEM. Document your approach, and what was learned by everyone
involved, to compete for this award.
