#### Best Software Tool

Regardless of what the topic is, iGEM projects often create or adapt
computational tools to move their overall project forward. Because they are born
out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational
methods) can even prove surprisingly useful for others. Without necessarily
being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's
success. This award tries to find and honor such "nuggets" of computational
work. To be eligible, your software has to be documented and made available
under an OSI-approved open-source license.

## What Should this Page Contain?

This page should aim to make your software accessible and understandable to a
wide audience, supplementing the detailed technical documentation available on
the repository.

- Provide a clear and concise overview of the software's purpose and
  functionality.
- Use non-technical language to make it accessible to a broad audience.
- Create step-by-step instructions on how to use the software.
- Include screenshots and visual aids to guide users.
- Explain how to integrate the software with other tools or platforms.
- Explain the key design choices made during the software's development.
- Discuss any trade-offs or compromises made during the design process.
- Provide a high-level overview of the software's architecture.
- Provide clear instructions on how to deploy and install the software.
- Provide an overview of the software's API, if applicable.
