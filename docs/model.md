#### Best Model

Models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the functioning
and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic biology is an engineering
discipline and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine
system behavior before building your design. Designing and simulating can be
iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for
teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or
simulate expected behavior before or in conjunction with experiments in the
wetlab.

To compete for the Best Model prize, please describe your work on this page and
