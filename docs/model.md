#### Best Model

Models and computer simulations can help us understand the function and
operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Simulation and modeling are critical
engineering skills that can contribute to project design or provide a better
understanding of the modeled process. These processes are even more useful
and/or informative when real-world data are included in the model. This award is
for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design
or simulate expected behavior before, or in conjunction with, experiments in the
wetlab.

## Overview

Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the
function and operation of Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering
discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the
behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be
iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab.
